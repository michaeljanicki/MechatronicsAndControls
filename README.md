# MechatronicsAndControls
This repository is for a collection of resources on controls and modeling, embedded computing, microprocessors, etc. intended to help with engineering robotics/controls projects.

The intention is to create a online resource bank for engineers to share and collaborate to make creating projects easier. 

## Background Summary
- myRIO (LabVIEW Real-Time Module) and sensor integration
- TIVA boards (IAR Workbench) with low-level computing and register setup
- Arduino for basic embedded computing and memory management
- Beaglebone Black implementation (no development)
